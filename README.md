# CS61A
This repository contain the learning material for the CS61A from the UCB.
# Video
I learn this course by watching the lecture videos from the course website.(www.cs61a.org)
# Some tools
I use vim in the terminal to code all the assignment just like john which just for fun.
Instead the website(code.cs61a.org) is a great place to code the exercise problems for this couse.
You can access a python interpreter by visit(code.cs61a.org/python), scheme by visit(code.cs61a.org/scheme), and sql the same way.
# Discussion
Finish the discussion in the course website is a great approch to learn and review the keypoint of the lecture.
